White Paper,MainContent,Modernizing Enterprise Systems,"Testing challenges in healthcare modernization Business transformation in healthcare is a complex endeavor, primarily due to the challenges in maintaining the integrity between different types of customer needs and health-related plans. Modernizing healthcare software applications mandates enabling a multi-directional flow of information across multiple systems, which can complicate the entire healthcare workflow. Furthermore, failures or errors in systems outside the enterprise environment can adversely affect the performance of applications with which they are integrated. To address such challenges, it is crucial to determine the right methods and types of end-to-end testing. This will optimize application performance by thoroughly testing it across all layers, from the front-end to the back-end, along with its interfaces and endpoints.Typically, most healthcare organizations employ multi-tier structures with multiple end-users, making end-to-end testing a very complex process. Launching a new product or implementing changes in such a multi-directional business scenario necessitates extensive user testing. Therefore, to enable effective end-to-end (E2E) testing, health insurance companies must first understand what customers expect from their healthcare providers and identify how they can meet these expectations within shorter timelines.In order to achieve successful healthcare modernization through end-to-end testing, Infosys leverages four modernization techniques: re-engineering, replacing or retiring, re-fronting, and re-platforming. Each technique requires specific testing approaches tailored to the unique requirements of the modernization process.Re-engineering technique: This approach is best-suited in cases where companies need to digitize healthcare product marketing to different constituents of a state through online retail. It involves simulating user-centric interactions, conducting compliance testing for security protocols and financial boundaries, and implementing blend testing to combine functional and structural testing into a single approach.Replacing or retiring technique: This technique is employed when there is a need to remove contract and legal documentation from healthcare insurance and hospitals to a separate online portal. It focuses on plug-and-play testing, web service-based testing, neutrality testing, parallel testing, assembly testing, and usability testing.Re-fronting technique: This approach is utilized when adding encryption logic protocol is required for sensitive claim-related information passing through a web service. It encompasses virtualization testing to simulate multiple users, non-functional testing to ensure platform integrity, and regression testing to verify system behavior.Re-platforming technique: This technique is implemented when upgrading billing/payments databases to recent versions is needed due to license renewals. It involves migration testing to ensure data integrity during technology upgrades, acceptance testing to maintain application recognition intensities, intrusive testing to analyze system behavior under unexpected variables, and volume testing to evaluate application stability under heavy load.Comparative analysis of various testing approaches is crucial to determine the most suitable method for each modernization technique."
